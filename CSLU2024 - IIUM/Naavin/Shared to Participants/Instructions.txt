Inside the 7z file is a VM. You need to extract the file from within it.

And then, you need Virtualbox (Download form https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run it.
Click File -> Import Appliance and navigate to the "ova" file you just extracted.

You should then be able to run the VM, and optionally tune it to your performance (Add
more RAM if you have a system that can handle it, for example).

After that, you can read the PDF document in this drive, that is  meant to be your guide, 
and is way more comprehensive than my slides (not shown here as you don't need it, everything
said in the slides is already in the PDF.).
